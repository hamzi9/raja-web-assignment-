      <h1>Introduction</h1>

      <p>In this assessment I was asked to develop the multiple web pages using the HTML and CSS. 
          As all the basic concepts were delivered in the class, I found the requirments of the 
          assessment were delivered during the lectures of the class. In this Report I will share 
          my exprience and all the challenges I faced during of developing this web site. 
          I created five pages each page containing the same theme and content which was required for the website.
      </p>
      <h1> First Phase of Development</h1>
      <p>
        During the first phase I read all the requirments very clearly and brainstrom all the concepts
        that were delivered in the class. Then started my development by firstly breaking the page wise 
        requirments and started implimenting them thorought the developmnt.
        I used the html tags properly on every page and didn't use the classes for each tag that made the site more professional.

      </p>
      <h1> Second Phase of Development</h1>
        <p>After completing the HTML files of all the pages I attached the CSS file and started styling all the pages.
          As it was very challenging for me to select the colors for making the theme that will apply on all the screens and 
          also it was very difficult to make the site responsive as it could work on both mobile and other divices.
          I learned and applied most CSS properties and a pplied them on all the screens and that increases the beauty of the site
          and the styles on each page.I set the burger Icon it the right place and make that useful
